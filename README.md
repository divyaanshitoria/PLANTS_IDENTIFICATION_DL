### Introduction

"Automated species identification was presented 15 years ago as a challenging but very promising solution for the development of new research activities in Taxonomy, Biology or Ecology. However, identifying a plant for a botanist means associating a scientific name to an individual plant. More precisely, that means assigning that individual plant to a group, called a taxon. Such taxon had a name selected according to a set of rules. The delimitation of taxa and the scientific names applying to them are the result of a process called taxonomy (or systematics)".[Taken from](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01913277/document)

Our project aims to create a solution that can identify a plant in an automated way. so Iâ€™m going to implement full CNN from scratch using Keras with a TensorFlow backend. This implementation will be performed on a dataset of five different kind flower. These flowers are daisy, dandelion, rose, sunflower and tulip.

### Technologies

- Python (Keras, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib)
- Google Colab (Colaboratory)
### Data Section

* ***Context***

This dataset contains 4242 images of flowers. The data collection is based on the data flicr, google images, yandex images. You can use this datastet to recognize plants from the photo. This dataset is available on [KAGGLE | LINK](https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition) or you can access it from this [repo](./data)

* ***Content***

The pictures are divided into five classes: chamomile, tulip, rose, sunflower, dandelion. For each class there are about 800 photos. Photos are not high resolution, about 320x240 pixels. Photos are not reduced to a single size, they have different proportions!




#### Required Libraries

```python
    """
      Here we are going to use Keras library 
      with a tensorflow backend
    """
    import keras
    from keras.models import Sequential
    from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPool2D, Dense, Flatten, Dropout
```
#### CNN Architecture Implementation 

```python
    model = Sequential() 
    model.add(Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3,3), padding='same', input_shape=X_train.shape[1:], activation='relu', name='Conv2D_1'))    
    model.add(Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3,3), activation='relu', name='Conv2D_2')) 
    model.add(MaxPool2D(pool_size=(2,2), name='Maxpool_1')) 
    model.add(Dropout(0.25)) 
    model.add(Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(3,3), padding='same', activation='relu', name='Conv2D_3')) 
    model.add(Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(3,3), activation='relu', name='Conv2D_4')) 
    model.add(MaxPool2D(pool_size=(2,2), name='Maxpool_2')) 
    model.add(Dropout(0.25)) 
    model.add(Conv2D(filters=128, kernel_size=(3,3), padding='same', activation='relu', name='Conv2D_5')) 
    model.add(Conv2D(filters=128, kernel_size=(3,3), activation='relu', name='Conv2D_6')) 
    model.add(MaxPool2D(pool_size=(2,2), name='Maxpool_3')) 
    model.add(Flatten()) 
    model.add(Dense(units=512, activation='relu', name='Dense_1')) 
    model.add(Dropout(0.5)) 
    model.add(Dense(units=128, activation='relu', name='Dense_2')) 
    model.add(Dense(units=no_of_classes, activation='softmax', name='Output'))   
```
#### Plotting Results


- From the Training and Validation Accuracy graph above, our model does not seem to be overfitted, which is great!
- Also, Our Training and Validation Loss graph above also indicates a good learning rate.


Note that, 0,1,2,3,4 values in this matrix means daisies, dandelions, roses, sunflowers, tulips respectively
- Our confusion matrix indicates that a lot of prediction errors came from distinguishing between rose and tulip.
